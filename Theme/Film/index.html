    <h1>History of Film Cameras</h1>
    
    <p>The history of the film camera is the history of the camera itself, dating as far back as 470 B.C.. It all began with the <em>"Camera Obscura,"</em> which is latin for "dark room.
        It's a natural phenomenon that when light is shone through a small hole, against a flat surface, it will display an image of what's on the other side against the flat wall, but flipped upside down.
        The oldest known record of this principle came from the Han Chinese philosopher Mozi.</p>
    <p>It wasn't until the 11th century, Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham wrote essays about the camera obscura which included experiments with light through a small opening in a darkened room. 
        Since the 17th century, portable camera obscura devices in tents and boxes were used as a drawing aid.</p>

    <p>It had been known for hundreds of years before the photographic camera that certain substances such as Silver Salts darkened when exposed to any type of light, so in a series of experiments in 1727
        it was demonstrated that silver salts darkened by light, and light alone. It was unaffected by heat or exposure to air. The same goes for Silver Chloride, but it was more sensitive than the salts except
        once darkened, it becomes insoluble in an ammonia solution, similar to the development process we use today.</p>

    <p>The first permanent photograph of a camera was made in 1828 using a sliding wooden box camera made by CHarles and Vincent Chevalier in Paris. The idea came from the phoenomenon of the camera obscura,
        by fixing a slab of pewter coated with bitumen (like silver salts/chrlodie, it darkened with exposure to light) in a dark room on the other side of the obscura hole. It took 8 hours of exposure
        to create an image, and finished with an ammonia solution to "fix it" or make it permament.</p>
    <p>The first photographic camera deaveloped for commercial manufacture was a daguerrotype camera which adopted the concept of the pewter slab but in a more portable format, using a wooden box as the camera 
    obscura. Each devise costed 400 francs (mind you it was 1839). Exposure time ranged from 5-30 minutes versus the modern fraction of a second today.</p>

    <p>By 1840, through deveopmental processes, exposure times were cut to just a few seconds thanks to chemical preparation and advances in lens design. Wet plate processes gradually replaced the 
        deguerrerotype cameras that offered a more sophisticated design. It allowed sensitizing and developing glass plates to be carried inside the camera itself rather in a seperate darkroom.
        Famous photographers like Ansel Adams used this type of process to create beautiful imagery of Yellowstone Park, which are now some of the most famous pieces of photography to date.</p>

    <p>Single Lens Reflex cameras came to development which provided a mirror to redirect light from the picture being taken to flip the upside down image created by the camera obscura to compose and focus an 
    image. When the shutter is released, the mirror swings up and away allowing the exposure of the photograph and instantly return the exposure which would burn the image onto a roll of film that we use today.</p>
    <p>The beautiful thing about film photography is that it uses the same concept that was developed hundreds of years ago, with more modern techniques by different chemicals and darkroom processes.</p>
