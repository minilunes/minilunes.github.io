    <h1>History of Digital Cameras</h1>
    
    <p>The first recorded instance of a digital camera came out of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1961, along with NASA who was trying to discover a way
        they could use a photosensor to capture digital imagery. They wanted to take pictures of the planets and stars as the satellites were flying through space. 
        This was only an idea though, as technology had yet to catch up with this radical idea.
        The first functional digital camera was introduced in 1975 called the Cromemco Cyclops. It's design was published by a hobbyist construction projected
        in Februrary 1975. it was originally used as a Metal Oxide Semiconductor.</p>

    <p>Steven Sasson, an engineer at Eastman Kodak invented and built the first self-contained electronic camera that used a charge-coupled device image sensor in 
        1975. It was used initially by the military and scientific purposes, followed by medical and news applications.</p>
        
    <p>In 1986, a Japanese company that we all are familiar with today named Nikon introduced the first Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) that we use today. They 
        built the Nikon SVC. It wasn't until the mid to late 1990's that DSLR cameras became a household item. By the mid 2000's, DSLR cameras had largely replaced
        film cameras.</p>

    <p>In 2000, Sharp introduced the world's first digital camera phone, the J-SHO4 J-Phone. By the mid 2000's, higher-end cell phones had an 
        integrated digital camera and by 2010, almost all smartphones had cameras.</p>
