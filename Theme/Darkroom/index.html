        <p>The darkroom is where all the magic happens; it's a room dedicated to the development of your image and roll of film. You have to use amber or red light or else your supplies will be exposed to photo-burning light. After developing a roll of film
            in complete darkness, you are able to take a strip of film (usually in 4-5 frame snippets. From there, you take the snippet onto an easel, a mechanism that affixes itself into the enlarger; a light is shone through from the top-down via a
            lightbulb and creates the imagery onto the platform as you see in the image above.</p>
        <p>Once you have your image established through the light and focused, you are able to place a piece of photosensitive paper (looks like regular printer paper but once exposed to any sort of light, will immediately begin to turn black/brown), onto
            the platform and expose your image onto it. You have to establish the <b>percect</b> amount of light and the <b>perfect</b> exposure time to create your image with enough constrast and brightness. It will first appear white until you dunk
            it in <em>developer.</em></p>
        <p>Developer is a mostly ammonia based chemical that takes up to 90 seconds to reveal a perfect image.</p>
        <p>After the develper process, you dunk it in <em>rinse.</em> It is again, mostly water that halts the development process.</p>
        <p>After the rinse, you dunk the image in <em>fixer.</em> It is a very stinky chemical that permeates your image, and makes it completely safe for light. At this point, you are able to take your image into a normally lit room where you can decide
            if you like it, or have to try again for better exposure, contrast, focus, etc.</p>
        <p>After the fixer, you rinse your image once again in 100% water to rid of any excess checmials and the terrible smell left from the fixer and <em>voila,</em> you have your image.</p>
