    <h1>My history with Cameras..</h1>

    <p>My first experience with cameras was in high school. I had a friend who was deep into the hobby because our high school offered photography classes that involved
    working with both film and digital cameras. I was fascinated by the process so I decided to enroll in Photo 1. We learned the basics of the film camera including 
    it's inner workings, the science behind it and how to go from loading a 35mm roll of film to developing photos in a darkroom. I fell in love.</p>
    
    <p>I initially shot on a Canon Rebel XS <b>(include photo)</b> that I borrowed from a friend and was eventually able to purchase a Canon AE -1 35mm film camera that I 
    found at goodwill for $20 dollars. I shoot on that camera to this day, 9 years later.</p>

    <p>I worked with film cameras for 2 years in high school until our school decided to hire a new photo teacher who was seriously into digital photography, mostly done in
    the studio. It wasn't my favorite but it taught me a lot about the modern photography styles. I took a semester of that and graduated. From there, I didn't bother with 
    photogrpahy as I had been busy with real world stuff after high school.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Bellevue College offers photography classes and it's an absolutely amazing program and I was lucky enough to take a class where I was able to get back 
    into the darkroom and freshen up on that process. That was my last quarter of my associates program so I have not been able to take any more classes as I have been busy
    with Programming! A new love!</p>
